In our design implementation, we came together in starting off with the lights and physics. Prior to the AI and Mecanim implementation we've already have a good chunk of the lights and physics already in with some tweaks. This inclucdes textures to objects of the buildings and on the given player weapon. 

Major changes for Assignment 6:

(Jakub Pekala)
- Leaky pipes were added in the office building to add more detail and aesthetic to the building.
- Zombies were added which follow the player. Pathfinding using a nav mesh was the driver behind the zombie AI.
- A walk animation was added to the zombies to satisfy the mecanim requirement.
